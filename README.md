# Structured learning

### What is structured learning?
A project that allows people to reinforce their data structure skills. This project was created so that people can have a better understanding of how different data structures work and more importantly when they are useful. A huge part of technical interviewing is being able to identify the data structure that is useful for solving a particular problem. This isn't a trivial skill to have and it takes practice to go from an abstract problem to an algorithm and then to code that actually runs the algorithm properly.

The best way to get started with preparing for technical interviews is through reinforcing the fundamentals of computer science. In this project, developers will create their own data structures and use them to solve problems presented to them. Currently the project will only be for data structures and algorithms that are usually learned in the first few semesters of a college CS curriculum.
