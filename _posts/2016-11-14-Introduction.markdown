Welcome to Structured Learning! The point of this page is to teach about data structures that are fundamental to Computer Science.
There is a distributable Eclipse project that is hosted on this page can be downloaded and each piece of the project will be taught through posts to this page.
The project begins with linear data structures and their applications and moves to more advanced structures like graphs.
The purpose of the project is to get a thorough understanding of data structures and their applications in solving problems.
