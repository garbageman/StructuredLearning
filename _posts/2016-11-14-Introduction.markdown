## Introduction
Welcome to Structured Learning! The point of this page is to teach about data structures that are fundamental to Computer Science.
There is a distributable Eclipse project that is hosted on this page can be downloaded and each piece of the project will be taught through posts to this page.
The project begins with linear data structures and their applications and moves to more advanced structures like graphs.
The purpose of the project is to get a thorough understanding of data structures and their applications in solving problems.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
This project is written in Java. The reason being that Java is a rather ubiquitous language and forces you to do a lot of work yourself. Scripting languages like Python and Ruby try to make coding easier but a lot of the nuances that come with data structure implementation will be abstracted away by the higher level programming languages. It is important to have an understanding of algorithm complexity. What is big O notation and what does it mean if a method or algorithm has a complexity of O(n)? Well big O notation is a way of describing how many steps it would take for an algorithm to finish given the input size, n, of the algorithm. An algorithm that takes O(1) time is an algorithm that does a constant amount of work regardless of how large
You can download the zip file that contains the project directory to your hard drive and import it through Eclipse. Once you have opened it through eclipse you can move on to the the first data structure [SinglyLinkedList]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-11-25-SinglyLinkedList.md %})
