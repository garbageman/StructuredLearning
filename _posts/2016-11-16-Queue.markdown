# Queues

## Discussion
Queues are useful datastructures for keeping track of elements in order to process them
in a first in, first out fashion. Queues operate the same way a line at a bank would, if you
are the first person to enter the line, then you are the first person to get serviced. When elements
are added to the Queue, they are added at one end, and when elements are removed, they are removed
from the other end.
